In the long run, it can cause serious problems such as heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, nerve damage, blindness, and amputation of the limbs. You should know that it can be prevented by doing regular physical activity, maintaining a healthy weight and eating healthy. If you have a family history of diabetes, you should be careful.

The first thing you should do is to try to identify the cause. Are you having any other symptoms like nausea, vomiting, fever, vision changes, weakness, etc.? Do you have any history of head trauma or stroke? What are the results of your blood pressure? Is there any history of high blood pressure in your family? Are you taking any medications? The next step is to do a physical examination. If you have any other symptoms and a physical examination is normal, it is probably a benign headache and you can take some over-the-counter painkillers. If you have a history of high blood pressure or any other symptoms, you should consult with a doctor and get some tests done. I hope this was helpful.\n",
